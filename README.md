nonsense
========

This is a collection of the strange utilities, or experiments that I've written over the years. I felt like I needed a place to keep my code so that I can go back to these ideas later and see how much I've improved. Feel free to submit bug fixes, fork, whatever you want. It's open source.

nonsense - text generator loosely based on markov chains.

cipher - loosely based on Pythagorean theorem.

weather - displays the current weather on your printer (if you have an HP printer with a character display on it)

csvtoxml - converts csv files to xml, edit it to mess around with it. uses a tokenlist and tag list to build the xml file however you want it. This one came to me in a dream, it's dumb but it works.

other files will be placed here as I play with them.
