nonsense
========

This is a collection of the strange utilities, or experiments that I've written over the years. I felt like I needed a place to keep my code so that I can go back to these ideas later and see how much I've improved. Feel free to submit bug fixes, fork, whatever you want. It's open source.

nonsense - text generator loosely based on markov chains. Included is the constitution, so it will generate nonsensical laws. Try feeding it both the constitution and alice in wonderland for generating surreal laws.

cipher - An encryption that is loosely based on Pythagorean theorem. Most encryption algorithms started from here and expanded. This one uses math that any 8th grader could understand. It has a bug in it, in that some divide not so evenly and thus the output is not 100% the original after you decrypt it. This makes it harder for cryptoanalysis, but you could end up with unintelligible messages. Adding more punctuation on the end seems to help. The key derivation function is "repeat".

weather - displays the current weather on your printer's character display (if you have an HP printer with a character display on it). Useful to see how to access an api and how to access UDP/TCP sockets with python.

csvtoxml - converts csv files to xml, edit it to mess around with it. uses a tokenlist and tag list to build the xml file however you want it. This one came to me in a dream, it's dumb but it works.

other files will be placed here as I play with them.
